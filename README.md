# JavaNewb
A repo with very simple, newbish Java programs. Don't Judge. 
The purpose of this repository is to store and document the simple applications I've been developing in Java.
The programs include:

### Program Index

* Assingment 1: "Quarterly Rainfall Calculatoin" - Program accepts input for Quarterly rainfall and outputs Total, Average, and Max and Min rainfall.
* Assingment 2: This is a fork of Assingment one. Program can accept multiple years as input and compute the same data as the program Assignment 1 does.
* Assingment 3: This program Simulates a Timer. 

Others Programs will be added in the future.
